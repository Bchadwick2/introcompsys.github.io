This section is to collect a variety of opinions on matters related to the course.

The topics below are not meant to be exhaustive.  The goal is to collect some
short readings that we can go through in class and then students can develop
their mental model of what the day to day *stuff* of programming really is and
begin to form their own opinions.  


Possible prompts:
- What's your favorite IDE and why?
- What's your favorite text editor and why?
- Do you use different tools for different types of programming and why?
- What's your most used shell?
- Describe your setup of windows, most used tools etc?
- How do you move code from idea to product?
- What stages of design actually fall within your day to day job (and what kind of role do you have)?
- Describe a debugging issue when understanding number representations, hardware, abstraction was the key?
- Flavors of git. which do you use and why?



To contribute, submit a PR that adds a markdown file to this folder. You may add
 an avatar or any contact information that you would like to share or remove the
 fields provided.  

Contributions should be made in good faith for the learning purposes of mid-level
undergraduates. I will make clarigying/tone edits as suggestions and allow you
to withdraw or continue iterating.
