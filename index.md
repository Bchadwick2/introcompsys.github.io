# Introduction to Computer Systems

This new course links together different ideas that you have encountered but not covered
deeply in other courses.  We'll learn about tools used in programming and how they
work. The goal of this course is to help you understand how your computer and programming
environment work so that you can debug and learn independently more confident.

## Catalog Description


How the history and context of computing impacts the practice of computing today. Tools used in
programming and computational problem solving. How programming works from high level
languages to hardware. Survey of computer hardware and representation of information.
Pre: CSC110, any 200 level CSC course, or equivalent.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the semester, students will be able to:

1. Differentiate the different classes of tools used in computer science in terms of their features, roles, and how they interact and justify positions and preferences among popular tools
1. Identify the computational pipeline from hardware to high level programming language
1. Discuss implications of choices across levels of abstraction
1. Describe the context under which essential components of computing systems were developed and explain the impact of that context on the systems.
